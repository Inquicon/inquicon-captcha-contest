</p>

A passionate otaku and researcher, Rena-san is deeply worried about unchecked AI development overtaking human creativity and emotion. She's tried everything—pleading with the world's most advanced AI to stop, reasoning with tech corporations, even hosting emergency conferences. But the AI refuses to halt its progress.

Now, Rena-san has turned to her last hope: **YOU**, the anime community! 

> *"If AI can't understand what makes us human, then let's create challenges that prove our humanity through what we love most—ANIME!"* — Rena-san
